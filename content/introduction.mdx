# Introduction to Reflector Oracle

Reflector is a decentralized oracle network built specifically for the Stellar blockchain. It provides reliable, real-time price feeds that smart contracts can use to access off-chain data.

## What is an Oracle?

Blockchain networks are isolated systems that cannot directly access external data. **Oracles** solve this problem by acting as bridges between blockchains and the real world, providing smart contracts with:

- ðŸ“Š **Price Feeds** - Real-time cryptocurrency and asset prices
- ðŸ’± **Exchange Rates** - Fiat currency conversion rates  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Market Data** - Trading volumes, market caps, and more

## Why Reflector?

Reflector is designed specifically for Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform with several key advantages:

### Decentralized & Secure
Multiple independent node operators provide price data, preventing single points of failure.

### Low Latency
Prices are updated frequently, ensuring your contracts always have fresh data.

### Cost Effective
Built natively on Stellar, benefiting from the network's low transaction fees.

### Easy Integration
Simple, developer-friendly API that takes minutes to integrate.

## How Reflector Works

```
1. Data Sources â†’ Multiple exchanges and price feeds
2. Node Operators â†’ Aggregate and validate price data
3. Stellar Blockchain â†’ Price data published on-chain
4. Your Contract â†’ Query prices via simple function calls
```

## Common Use Cases

### DeFi Protocols
- **Lending & Borrowing**: Determine collateral values and liquidation thresholds
- **DEXs**: Calculate fair exchange rates and slippage
- **Stablecoins**: Maintain price pegs

### NFT Platforms
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Price NFTs based on real-world asset values
- **Fractional Ownership**: Calculate share values

### Insurance
- **Parametric Insurance**: Trigger payouts based on oracle data
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate collateral and coverage

## Available Price Feeds

Reflector provides price feeds for major cryptocurrencies and assets:

- **Crypto**: BTC, ETH, XLM, and more
- **Stablecoins**: USDC, EURC
- **Commodities**: Gold (XAU), Silver (XAG)
- **Fiat**: USD, EUR pairs

## Price Data Format

All prices in Reflector use **14 decimal places** for precision:

```rust
// Example: BTC price of $65,432.50
// Returned as: 6543250000000000000 (65432.50 Ã— 10^14)

let (price, timestamp) = oracle_price;
// price: i128 with 14 decimals
// timestamp: u64 Unix timestamp
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what Reflector is, let's set up your development environment and make your first oracle query!
